#### Background
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/markleeblog/?fref=ts" target="_blank">I'm Mark</a> is one of the most popular comic blogs in Taiwan. It has more than 700,000 followers on facebook page. Mark is the main cartoon character, who is a staff at the bottom of company but keeps an optimistic attitude all the time.

#### Design 
Boss Earphone is designed in this unique Mark's spirit. As we can see in the cartoon on this page, boss is dictatorial and refuses to listen to others. In the working time, we have to obey others sometimes. 
So I designed a pair of Boss Earphones decorated with corks at the end like in the comics. When you put on them, it feels like you are the boss and you don't need to bow at every word of others. Boss Earphone creates a kingdom of your own.

Earphone storage box is shaped after the most remarkable feature of the boss: the vampire teeth and square-shaped mustache. After storing the earphone cable, you can place the earphones in opposite sides exactly. It will seem to be two corks stuck in boss's ears, and it will strengths the brand impression of I'm Mark.

This design has been appreciated by the author of I'm Mark and was selected as the excellent design in class.
