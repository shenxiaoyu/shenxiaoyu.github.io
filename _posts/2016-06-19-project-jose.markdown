JosephOTO is a start-up project to build a platform for freelance photographers to show their portfolio and get in touch with potential customers. This platform runs as an <a href="https://admin.wechat.com/" target="_blank">official Accounts on WeChat</a> (WeChat ID: josephoto), which pushes more than 40 long messages and gains around 1000 followers during its active days (2013.11-2014.8). 

Our team has 6 ZJU students with interdisciplinary backgrounds. Together we wrote a complete business plan and participated in a Chinese start-up competition. I contributed this project as the project leader and the manager of the WeChat account who ran the platform for one year.
