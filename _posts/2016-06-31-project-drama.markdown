#### Background
Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder that is characterized by social impairments. Children with autism may have trouble understanding the non-verbal emotion cues. It ends up with difficulties in isolation from their peers and difficulty to integrate in everyday life situations. This project embeds the training process in a digital game, which persuades children to develop a skill or behavior with enjoyment.

#### Final Design
My Drama is a story-based game application that helps children with autism to understand emotions in context. Elements of drama therapy and mobile game design were integrated to let players experience taking perspectives by assuming the role of the cartoon character, practicing context-dependent recognition of expressed emotions in the story and collecting story-related emotional expression photographs in a known environment.
A cartoon movie The Song of the Sea has been adopted as the story background in My Drama. The script of the game is adapted from the original story to make the tasks fit into the storyline smoothly. Tasks that intend to help understanding of emotional states were divided into four increasingly complex levels and embedded in the storyline: emotion learning, facial expression recognition, emotion expression in the context and social interaction with the people around. By experiencing being in another peopleâ€™s shoe, practicing communication and social skills in a safe environment, children can develop emotional skills with enjoyment.

#### Design Process
This design was developed and polished with an iterative design process and formatting testing.

My Drama was piloted with one therapist and two 15-year-old autistic teenagers at <a href="http://www.kentalis.nl/" target="_blank">Royal Dutch Kentalis</a>. It was evaluated mainly from the perspective of learning effectiveness, playfulness and interaction. The outcomes of the test indicate that My Drama is a promising and engaging training tool for emotion understanding while collecting of emotional expression photographs increased the communication. Playfulness eliminated the anxiety of being trained, but retained the effect of learning and prolonged training time.
