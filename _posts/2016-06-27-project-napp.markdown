#### Background
This module is mainly about developing competency in designing business processes via case study, learning about hypothesis driven innovation, and working on real case provided by Philips Design. Smart Parenting was chosen as the assignment of our group.

#### Final Design
It is not easy to become a new parent. The concept NAPP responses to the opportunity of the difficulty to become a new parent. NAPP is a cloud-based application service that gathers data on baby patterns, allowing for better communication and parental reassurance through awareness and sense of control.

#### Design Process
This concept was developed and polished with business model analysis, business pre-start analysis, and Minimum Viable Product method. Issues like how to find the balance point between business and design were continuously discussed during the process. For me, by being responsible for the concept video, I presented a plausible proposal by telling a good story and also by providing clear rationales.
