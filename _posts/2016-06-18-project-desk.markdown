Triangle of Life is a student desk concept to provide a save space to hide in during earthquake.  When an earthquake happens, common students desks are not strong enough to serve as a protection from the building collapse. In many earthquake-prone regions, many teenagers died or injured because of the limited save space to hide. With Triangle of Life, once an earthquake strikes, students can quickly hide under the desks. Triangle of Life apples the structure of triangle which enhances stability. Having a handle inside, it is easy and convenient to be shut and create a stable triangular hollow space.
This three-day short design case was developed with three other team mates. My main contributions are concept development, product description and graphic design.
