&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neck pain is a very common problem among office workers because of prolonged sedentary behaviors and absence of movements. This project aims to design a daily healthcare product for sedentary people to prevent neck pain by encouraging regular rest breaks and neck exercises. For such a product, the challenge is to fit into people’s daily activities seamlessly and increase users’ adherence to support long-term intervention program. So far, this project received positive feedback and was invited to exhibit at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eindhovenmakerfaire.nl/?lang=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eindhoven Maker Faire 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-design&quot;&gt;Final Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neckio is your daily neck care companion. It comprises a software program and a wireless tracking device on headphone. You can simply schedule neck exercises and set reminders. Neckio provides an intuitive, relaxing and interactive experience of doing neck exercises. With clear guidance and real-time feedback, you can check whether your exercise movements are in place. During working,  Neckio always keeps an eye on your sitting posture and work pace to prevent you from bad posture and prolonged sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was conceived based on an extensive user survey (N=130) and an iterative design process with formative testing. Different strategies of involving people are adopted in different stages of design. A short-term evaluation was conducted in the working place. System user experience and users’ intrinsic motivation were evaluated positively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iterative design&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Drama</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
	&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/131111426?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder that is characterized by social impairments. Children with autism may have trouble understanding the non-verbal emotion cues. It ends up with difficulties in isolation from their peers and difficulty to integrate in everyday life situations. This project embeds the training process in a digital game, which persuades children to develop a skill or behavior with enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Impairments resulted from autism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/drama-3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Impairments resulted from autism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-design&quot;&gt;Final Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Drama is a story-based game application that helps children with autism to understand emotions in context. Elements of drama therapy and mobile game design were integrated to let players experience taking perspectives by assuming the role of the cartoon character, practicing context-dependent recognition of expressed emotions in the story and collecting story-related emotional expression photographs in a known environment.
A cartoon movie The Song of the Sea has been adopted as the story background in My Drama. The script of the game is adapted from the original story to make the tasks fit into the storyline smoothly. Tasks that intend to help understanding of emotional states were divided into four increasingly complex levels and embedded in the storyline: emotion learning, facial expression recognition, emotion expression in the context and social interaction with the people around. By experiencing being in another people’s shoe, practicing communication and social skills in a safe environment, children can develop emotional skills with enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Drama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/drama-page.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;My Drama&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This design was developed and polished with an iterative design process and formatting testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Iterative Design Process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/drama-process.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Iterative Design Process&quot; /&gt;
My Drama was piloted with one therapist and two 15-year-old autistic teenagers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kentalis.nl/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Royal Dutch Kentalis&lt;/a&gt;. It was evaluated mainly from the perspective of learning effectiveness, playfulness and interaction. The outcomes of the test indicate that My Drama is a promising and engaging training tool for emotion understanding while collecting of emotional expression photographs increased the communication. Playfulness eliminated the anxiety of being trained, but retained the effect of learning and prolonged training time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pilot test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/151781870?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When interacting with devices such as mobile phones and computers, people are often completely distracted from their other activities. On the contrary, all kinds of everyday things can be done without focused attention. This project explored how to build on the way people effortlessly divide their attention over several everyday activities by designing interactive controller for Philips Hue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Current application controller of Philips Hue&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/bux-hue.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Current application controller of Philips Hue&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-design&quot;&gt;Final Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bux is a controller for Philips Hue Light to interact with the lighting ambiance at home in an effortless way. Turning on or off the light is as simple as tapping the stick or the ball. The four corners represent four light modes and the center of the cross pattern is a default scene, which can be personalized by the user. You can choose light mode by simply moving the stick to that direction. The brightness can be adjusted by sliding the ball up and down. Bux also supports detailed control in the app, where the physical interface will automatically change with your adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;BUX&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/bux.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;BUX&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on attention theory research, a video analysis was used to find the possibility of perform activities performed in periphery of attention effortlessly even without noticing it. We started a search for simple interactions in daily life by dirty prototyping. After brainstorming and some tryouts, a gearbox-like controller (a ball with slider) was chosen as a starting point of our design. The process towards the final outcome came with frequent design iterations where potential peripheral factors were identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design Process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/bux-process.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Design Process&quot; /&gt;
Ease of use doesn’t mean the interaction is peripheral. To tell whether an interaction is peripheral depends on the mental resource demand. Therefore, evaluating the designs with users in a stimulative context is necessary to get feedback and make further design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dutch Tea Ceremony</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/113011947?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our lives are a collection of rituals. The way we wake up, the way we leave or enter our home, the way we prepare our dinner are just simple examples of the many rituals in our everyday lives. These rituals are not rigid procedures, but a seemingly established series of activities from which experiential meaning emerges, and by which personal values are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-design&quot;&gt;Final Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the Japanese tea ceremony, values of the ritual were explored and the tea set was re-designed for a Dutch tea ceremony. The experiential mood this design tried to communicate is hospitality, taking care and sharing company. To create an equal, free and open environment, the tea set was designed to be portable so that people can take it to any place and enjoy tea with friends. The central wireframe works as a storage space, around which a blanket can be unfolded to serve as the tea table. On the tea ceremony, the tea master uses re-designed tools to make tea for the every guest. One receives a warm cup of tea from the host and is also able to remain and enjoy that warmth for a longer period of time by a heating coaster that fits the glass perfectly. This all represents the idea of sharing warmth in the ‘gezelligheid’ (sociability) of our tea ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tea set&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/ExploringRitualsGIF.gif&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Tea set&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/tea-design.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Tea set&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design of dutch tea ceremony was the result of a two-week module to address qualities embodied in rituals from an interaction design perspective and gain insights in reciprocal nature of these influences between the artifacts and the ritual. Although allocated to three groups focusing on different artifacts (tea table, tea cups and tea making tools), 17 students worked together in two weeks for this overarching ritual design, which is a great challenge of communication and cooperation. Within in the tea table team, I was mainly responsible for the final photography and designing of the portable tea table and cushions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Design Process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective persuasion results in a change to a person’s behavior, attitude or belief. This project aims to bridge the theory and design on the topic of Persuasive Technology. In this design case, persuasive technology is applied to stimulate physical activities of office employees within every day work routines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-design&quot;&gt;Final Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final concept of ‘Pop’ intends to persuade the user to take short physical breaks between periods of sedentary work. Pop has conceptual roots in Trans Theoretical Model and design cues from adapted from Design with Intent principle. Pop measures and store cumulative physical exercise of individual users and visualize need for activity both on individual screen as well as on an ambient display. Physical inactivity of a user is represented as bubbles on ambient display which get bigger during sedentary behavior.  A colleague may choose to pop the anonymous big bubble, and remind the its owner of taking a break on his/her personal computer screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Screenshots of the final concept video&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept rooted in both persuasive technology theories and real context. Real users were involved into context exploration phase. Various theories were carefully selected and adopted during concept development to inspire new ideas or ground concept with solid theorized reasons, such as Fogg Behavior Model, Design with Intention, Trans Theoretical Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;User-involved context exploration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module is mainly about developing competency in designing business processes via case study, learning about hypothesis driven innovation, and working on real case provided by Philips Design. Smart Parenting was chosen as the assignment of our group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;final-design&quot;&gt;Final Design&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not easy to become a new parent. The concept NAPP responses to the opportunity of the difficulty to become a new parent. NAPP is a cloud-based application service that gathers data on baby patterns, allowing for better communication and parental reassurance through awareness and sense of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;design-process&quot;&gt;Design Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concept was developed and polished with business model analysis, business pre-start analysis, and Minimum Viable Product method. Issues like how to find the balance point between business and design were continuously discussed during the process. For me, by being responsible for the concept video, I presented a plausible proposal by telling a good story and also by providing clear rationales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Process Overview&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;People can spend plenty of time on smartphone unintentionally everyday. In order to establish healthy using habits of smartphones, I designed an app called “Apptitude”， which aims to raise awareness on everyday use of mobile apps.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;App Usage Monitor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/app-1.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;App Usage Monitor&quot; /&gt;
App Usage Monitor: Appttitude will collect the data of time and power consuming on each app and show the results in a pie chart to reveal the use habit. Moreover,you can find friends share the same habit of you.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alarm Clock&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/app-3.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Alarm Clock&quot; /&gt;
Alarm Clock: You can set an alarm clock for certain types of apps. Once the time you set for these apps is used up, Appttitude will send a message to remind you.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;App Recommendation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/app-2.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;App Recommendation&quot; /&gt;
App Recommendation: According to the statistical results, Apptitude will recommend apps that are suitable for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;item-figure&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application Structure (Chinese)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>See-cret Voice</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/170755942?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See-cret Voice is a pair of interactive answering machines to enhance emotion connection between people like friends, couples or family. People can talk to their own See-cret Voice in different places and the voice message can be delivered to each other. The upper part changes shape to indicate if there is a unread message. The final prototype is a single machine with the function of voice record and play, and shape changing.

&lt;p&gt;User can touch the holder at bottom to record voice message. During recording, the upper part will expand according to the time length of message to indicate
 a unread message. The other user can touch on the top and play the message. In the mean while, the upper part will slowly change back to the original shape.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/onefi.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;First version of UI design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onefi is a mobile application to simplify the process of Internet connection in campus. Traditional wifi connection requires student number and password every time. Now Onefi enables users to access campus Wifi with only one click, which reduces 90% of time that traditional authentication method needs. Quick and customized app navigation will be shown right after successful Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it supports both iOS and android. Targeting at college students, it gained more than 3000 users in only two weeks, 50% of them were active users. Onefi was used 8.59 times per day on average.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Couple Car</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/car-1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Couple Car&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;img/portfolio/pic/car-post.png&quot; class=&quot;img-responsive img-centered&quot; alt=&quot;Use of Couple Car&quot; /&gt;
Couple Car is a future automobile concept for fulfilling different needs in family transportation. During work days, Couple Car can be split into two individual cars and driven separately by family members. During the family days, the two compact cars can be joined to create a double-sized vehicle, offering a sharable space for all family members.
This three-day short design case was developed with three other team mates. My main contributions are concept development, product description, graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;
