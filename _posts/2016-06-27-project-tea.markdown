#### Background
Our lives are a collection of rituals. The way we wake up, the way we leave or enter our home, the way we prepare our dinner are just simple examples of the many rituals in our everyday lives. These rituals are not rigid procedures, but a seemingly established series of activities from which experiential meaning emerges, and by which personal values are expressed.

#### Final Design
Starting from the Japanese tea ceremony, values of the ritual were explored and the tea set was re-designed for a Dutch tea ceremony. The experiential mood this design tried to communicate is hospitality, taking care and sharing company. To create an equal, free and open environment, the tea set was designed to be portable so that people can take it to any place and enjoy tea with friends. The central wireframe works as a storage space, around which a blanket can be unfolded to serve as the tea table. On the tea ceremony, the tea master uses re-designed tools to make tea for the every guest. One receives a warm cup of tea from the host and is also able to remain and enjoy that warmth for a longer period of time by a heating coaster that fits the glass perfectly. This all represents the idea of sharing warmth in the ‘gezelligheid’ (sociability) of our tea ritual.

#### Design Process
The design of dutch tea ceremony was the result of a two-week module to address qualities embodied in rituals from an interaction design perspective and gain insights in reciprocal nature of these influences between the artifacts and the ritual. Although allocated to three groups focusing on different artifacts (tea table, tea cups and tea making tools), 17 students worked together in two weeks for this overarching ritual design, which is a great challenge of communication and cooperation. Within in the tea table team, I was mainly responsible for the final photography and designing of the portable tea table and cushions.
