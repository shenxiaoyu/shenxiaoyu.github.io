#### Background
Effective persuasion results in a change to a person’s behavior, attitude or belief. This project aims to bridge the theory and design on the topic of Persuasive Technology. In this design case, persuasive technology is applied to stimulate physical activities of office employees within every day work routines.

#### Final Design 
The final concept of ‘Pop’ intends to persuade the user to take short physical breaks between periods of sedentary work. Pop has conceptual roots in Trans Theoretical Model and design cues from adapted from Design with Intent principle. Pop measures and store cumulative physical exercise of individual users and visualize need for activity both on individual screen as well as on an ambient display. Physical inactivity of a user is represented as bubbles on ambient display which get bigger during sedentary behavior.  A colleague may choose to pop the anonymous big bubble, and remind the its owner of taking a break on his/her personal computer screen.

#### Design Process
This concept rooted in both persuasive technology theories and real context. Real users were involved into context exploration phase. Various theories were carefully selected and adopted during concept development to inspire new ideas or ground concept with solid theorized reasons, such as Fogg Behavior Model, Design with Intention, Trans Theoretical Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, etc.
