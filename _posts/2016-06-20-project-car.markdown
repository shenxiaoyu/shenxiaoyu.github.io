Couple Car is a future automobile concept for fulfilling different needs in family transportation. During work days, Couple Car can be split into two individual cars and driven separately by family members. During the family days, the two compact cars can be joined to create a double-sized vehicle, offering a sharable space for all family members.
This three-day short design case was developed with three other team mates. My main contributions are concept development, product description, graphic design.
