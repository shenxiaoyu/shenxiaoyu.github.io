#### Background
When interacting with devices such as mobile phones and computers, people are often completely distracted from their other activities. On the contrary, all kinds of everyday things can be done without focused attention. This project explored how to build on the way people effortlessly divide their attention over several everyday activities by designing interactive controller for Philips Hue.

#### Final Design
Bux is a controller for Philips Hue Light to interact with the lighting ambiance at home in an effortless way. Turning on or off the light is as simple as tapping the stick or the ball. The four corners represent four light modes and the center of the cross pattern is a default scene, which can be personalized by the user. You can choose light mode by simply moving the stick to that direction. The brightness can be adjusted by sliding the ball up and down. Bux also supports detailed control in the app, where the physical interface will automatically change with your adjustment.

#### Design Process
Based on attention theory research, a video analysis was used to find the possibility of perform activities performed in periphery of attention effortlessly even without noticing it. We started a search for simple interactions in daily life by dirty prototyping. After brainstorming and some tryouts, a gearbox-like controller (a ball with slider) was chosen as a starting point of our design. The process towards the final outcome came with frequent design iterations where potential peripheral factors were identified.

Ease of use doesn’t mean the interaction is peripheral. To tell whether an interaction is peripheral depends on the mental resource demand. Therefore, evaluating the designs with users in a stimulative context is necessary to get feedback and make further design decisions.
