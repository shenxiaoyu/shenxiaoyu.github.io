#### Background
Neck pain is a very common problem among office workers because of prolonged sedentary behaviors and absence of movements. This project aims to design a daily healthcare product for sedentary people to prevent neck pain by encouraging regular rest breaks and neck exercises. For such a product, the challenge is to fit into people’s daily activities seamlessly and increase users’ adherence to support long-term intervention program. So far, this project received positive feedback and was invited to exhibit at <a href="http://www.eindhovenmakerfaire.nl/?lang=en" target="_blank">Eindhoven Maker Faire 2016</a>.

#### Final Design
Neckio is your daily neck care companion. It comprises a software program and a wireless tracking device on headphone. You can simply schedule neck exercises and set reminders. Neckio provides an intuitive, relaxing and interactive experience of doing neck exercises. With clear guidance and real-time feedback, you can check whether your exercise movements are in place. During working,  Neckio always keeps an eye on your sitting posture and work pace to prevent you from bad posture and prolonged sedentary behavior.

#### Design Process
The system was conceived based on an extensive user survey (N=130) and an iterative design process with formative testing. Different strategies of involving people are adopted in different stages of design. A short-term evaluation was conducted in the working place. System user experience and users’ intrinsic motivation were evaluated positively.
